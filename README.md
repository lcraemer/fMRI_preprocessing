# fMRI Preprocessing Pipeline

This repository contains code to preprocess fMRI data.

## Getting Started

The code requires [BIDS](http://bids.neuroimaging.io) formatted data. Preprocessing steps include realignment, slicetiming correction, normalization, estimation of noise components and smoothing. We have two main files:

* runPreprocessing: This runs the specified preprocessing pipeline
* prepobj: Preprocessing class definition file

Add the corresponding folder to the Matlab path. In the runPreprocessing script, add the SPM path and indicate where the BIDS data directory is located. 

## Please Note

The code has not yet been properly tested and verified. Run your own checks and report issues to help improve this pipeline. 

## Built With

* [Matlab](https://de.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)
